        Nutrition begins with food. Nutrition is the process by which the body
        nourishes itself by transforming food into energy and body tissues. The
        science of nutrition concerns everything the body does with food to
        carry on its functions. Food provides essential substances called
        nutrients. The body needs these nutrients to help it make energy; to
        grow, repair, and maintain its tissues; and to keep its different
        systems working smoothly. Nutrition is important for all organisms.
        However, this article will focus on nutrition as it applies to the human
        body.

        The term nutrition can also refer to the quality of someoneâ€™s food
        choices, or diet. A balanced diet is one in which foods eaten on a
        regular basis provide all the nutrients needed in the right amounts. A
        balanced diet has many benefits. It can help people feel and look their
        best.
