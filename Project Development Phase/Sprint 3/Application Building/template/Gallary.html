      </h2>
      <p>Some people like to cut back on sugar while focused on a weight loss goal. Apples do contain sugar, about 20 grams per apple. However, these are natural sugars and are released slowly due to the high fiber content of apples which delays digestion. Whole fruits like apples are actually associated with weight loss and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #07ebb9">2.Banana Nutrition Facts</h2>
      <p>
        Bananas are low in fat, with less than 0.5 grams per medium-sized banana. Because there are small amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A and K in bananas, consuming them with fat can help unlock that nutritional benefit. A two-tablespoon serving of peanut butter contains about 10 grams of monounsaturated fat, 3.3 grams of polyunsaturated fat, and just 2.8 grams of saturated fat, and is a popular pairing with banana.

      <h2 style="color: #07ebb9">3.Orange Nutrition Facts</h2>
      <p>Most people think of oranges as an excellent source of vitamin C (and they are). Oranges also offer a variety of other healthful nutrients, like calcium, potassium, fiber, and folate. Plus, they're easy to find, eat, store, and cook with , and oranges are low in calories.

        Bitter oranges, such as Seville and bergamot, are used primarily for the essential oils found in their zest or skin.1
        
         For example, oil of bergamot gives Earl Grey tea its distinctive flavor.</p>
